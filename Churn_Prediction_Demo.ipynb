    "# Predicting Employee Churn \n",
    "Prepared by Nick Freeman, PhD.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook considers the problem of predicting employee churn for the purpose of demonstrating several machine learning techniques in Python. Employee churn refers to the turnover in an organization's staff as existing employees leave and new ones are hired. The churn rate is typically calculates as the percent of employees leaving the company over some specified time period. Although some staff turnover is inevitable, a high rate of churn is costly because of the associated costs of hiring and training. Moreover, it can take several months for a new hire to acclimate to a new position, and longer before the company realizes any return on their hiring investments. If an organization can predict the attributes that may cause an employee to leave, interventions may be planned to reduce churn.\n",

    "We will now turn our attention to preparing the data for our machine learning analysis. The machine learning algorithms that we will consider require numerical input data. Therefore, we need to develop a numerical representation for the categorical data contained in the `department` and `salary_level` columns. The following code block uses Pandas `get_dummies()` method for `DataFrame` objects to generate a binary representation for these columns. This conversion is commonly referred to as *one hot encoding*."

    "The following code block specifies the set of columns in the `data` object that we will pass to our machine learning algorithms as features. The machine learning algorithms that we consider will attempt to learn patterns of these features that explain variation in the target variable, which for our problem is the value in the `left_company` column. We then split the dataset into two parts, training and testing datasets. The machine learning algorithms will use the training dataset when learning the patterns of features that affect the target. The testing dataset will be used to investigate the accuracy of the learned models. We specify that 70% of the data be used for training and the remianing 30% be used for testing.\n",

    "After splitting the data into training and testing sets, the `fit_models` function that fits several popular machine learning models to the training dataset. The function plots a model comparison that shows the accuracy of the models fit to the data. The function also returns the name of the best model, an object that contains the model fit, and the predictions for the test dataset"
